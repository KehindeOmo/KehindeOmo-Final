    My name is Kehinde Omoloja, but I also go by Keh (K). A couple fun facts about me is that I am Nigerian and I also have a twin. I major in Information technology and I am an RA here at Mizzou. Not to mention, I really enjoy playing games and dressing up. My favorite color is pink and I love practically everything girly. I am apart of many organizations here on campus and enjoy being apart of the community. I really love coding and the fact that there is always something new to learn in my degree. I like all types of pasta and all types of rice as well.  When I am not usually indulged in my academics, I am probably with my friends or sleeping. Afrobeats is my favorite genre of music, so much that I could literally listen to it all day long. Some honorably mentions from my list would be Burna Boy, Asake, and Shallipopi.
    I used https://app.readable.com/text/?demo to check my writing.
