        Coming into college I had little to no experience in coding. 
        All I knew is that I simply loved technology and all that it 
        was capable of doing. The process of exploring the realm of 
        programming was both stimulating and intimidating. However, 
        as I got more involved in my classes, I saw that I made the 
        best decision in terms of my major. My love for coding was 
        fueled by the satisfaction of coming up with ways to achieve
        things and problem-solving. 
        <p>While here, I have worked on a lot of assignments that have exposed 
            me to a range of programming languages. Some tasks have been difficult 
            and even tested my capabilities, others have been interesting and made 
            me want to learn more. Despite the occasional difficulties and setbacks, 
            I was and still am persistent because I know that each obstacle presents 
            a chance for improvement. I have come a long way thanks to my commitment 
            and I can honestly say I am beyond proud of myself.

            Iâ€™m excited to explore internship opportunities that will offer real-world
 experiences that will help me in the future. Not only will I be able to 
 showcase my abilities, but these internships will help me to discover my 
 areas of interest and strengths. I am thrilled to dive into various projects,
  pick the brains of industry experts and acquire valuable insight that will 
  help shape my career path and direct my future.
With every day that goes by, I realize how closer I am to realizing my genuine 
passion and what path I want to pursue

            All in all, my great love for technology, and my unwavering commitment to achieving 
my goals act as the motivation behind my advancement in this field. Not to mention, 
because innovation and progress are always taking place in the technology industry 
it guarantees new possibilities and change. A constant state of intellectual stimulation
and professional growth is ensured and essentially means that you can never get bored
in this field, which is exactly what I need. :D
