        <h3>Here is a little <b>about me</b>......</h3>
        <p>
            Hello welcome to my <em>corner of the web</em>! My name is Kehinde Omoloja and
            I have always been fascinated about technology. I am a driven university
            student who is unraveling the exciting parts about the Information Technology
            field here at the University of Missouri. After my estimated graduation date
            in May 2026, I aspire to continue my technology journey by exploring more 
            about the realm of software engineering. On a more personal level, I also have
            the privilege of being apart of a Nigerian household while also sharing the 
            joys of having a twin sister. Outside of school, I am total gamer girl with 
            a girly side who <em> fashion </em> and the color pink. I personally believe in 
            embracing every aspect of who I am and I definitely wonâ€™t stop now or ever.<br>
Xoxo Kehinde
